# BarnMonitor 123456789010111213

## Fullstack Project using Flask and React

## Introduction

BarnMonitor is a fullstack application that provides a system for managing farm animals, including health records, production data, feed tracking, and sales information. The backend API is built with Flask, using SQLAlchemy for the ORM, Bcrypt for password hashing, and Alembic for database migrations. The frontend is developed using React, allowing users to interact with the system through a clean, modern interface.

## Models

## Features

- Farmers can manage their animals, including tracking health records, production, feed, and sales.
- API endpoints for managing farmers, animals, and their related records.
- Passwords are securely hashed using Bcrypt.
- Full CRUD functionality for all models.
- Data validation to ensure data integrity for health records, production data, and sales records.
- Database migrations are handled using Alembic for easy schema updates.

## Database

Make sure to run the migrations and seed the database to initialize the tables and seed sample data.
